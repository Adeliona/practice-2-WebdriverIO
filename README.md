# JS UI Automation Frameworks: WDIO, Cypress, Playwright

## Task

1. Walk through the provided materials (official documentation, videos) to understand how WDIO works and the main benefits of the tool.
2. Create an initial setup of WDIO on the local machine.
3. Create WDIO config if it does not exist and familiarize yourself with it.
4. Create first specs using the existing BDD scenarios created in Module 2.
5. Execute these tests using CLI in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) in headless mode.
6. Execute tests in parallel using 2 instances.
7. Add the option to run tests 2 times before marking them as failed.
8. Push the code to remote repository and create a Merge Request.

## Assessment Criteria (pass rate: 70%)

The following actions may result in reduction of the overall mark for a completed task:

1. WDIO setup with trivial mistakes (-10%).
2. Not all scenarios from Module 1 are coded (each missing test -5%).
3. Tests are not run in all mentioned browsers (-10%).
4. Tests are not run in parallel (-5%).
5. Tests are not run in headless mode (-5%).
6. Retry/auto-rerun test option isnâ€™t added (-5%).
